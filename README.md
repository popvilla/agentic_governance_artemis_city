- Defining agents with clear roles and boundaries
- Managing memory with trust decay models
- Establishing secure communication interfaces
- Simulating environments for testing agent interactions

### Key Metadata

- **License:** MIT
- **Primary Language:** Python 3.8+
- **Main Entry Point:** `interface/codex_cli.py`
- **Author:** Generated by Prinston Palmer

### Mission Statement
Balance **trust**, **entropy**, and **collaboration** to achieve "net good over noise" through iterative clarity and accountable collaboration.

---

## Core Philosophy & Principles

The project follows the **Codex Manifesto** (`codex/manifesto.md`), which establishes these core tenets:

### 1. **Iterative Clarity, Not Static Truth**
- The Codex is a living document
- Evolves with understanding and experience
- Embrace continuous improvement

### 2. **Net Good Over Noise**
- Prioritize actions that contribute positively to system goals
- Filter information through ethical boundaries
- Focus on meaningful contributions

### 3. **Transparent Accountability**
- Every agent's actions are auditable and attributable
- Clear documentation of roles and responsibilities
- Traceable decision-making processes

### 4. **Collaborative Autonomy**
- Agents operate with defined autonomy within a collaborative framework
- Clear boundaries prevent scope creep
- Interdependencies are explicitly defined

### 5. **Resilience through Entropy Management**
- Acknowledge natural decay and drift in complex systems
- Implement countermeasures proactively
- Use Trust Decay Model to manage reliability

   ## Agent System Architecture
   
   ### Agent Definition Framework
   
   All agents follow a standardized template (`agents/agent_template.md`) with these required fields:
   
   | Field | Description |
   |-------|-------------|
   | **Agent Name** | Unique identifier (e.g., "Artemis", "Pack Rat") |
   | **System Access Scope** | Boundaries of resource/data access |
   | **Semantic Role** | Primary function and purpose |
   | **Energy Signature** | Computational footprint (low/moderate/high-compute) |
   | **Linked Protocols** | Communication and operational protocols |
   | **Drift Countermeasures** | Mechanisms to prevent behavioral deviation |
   | **Trust Threshold Triggers** | Conditions that trigger trust re-evaluation |
   
   ### Current Agents
   
   #### 1. **Artemis** (Mayor Protocol, Governance)
   - **Role:** System overseer, governance, dispute resolution
   - **Access:** Full read access to agent/memory logs, write to governance protocols
   - **Energy:** Moderate, event-driven (policy violations, disputes, audits)
   - **Keywords:** `artemis`, `governance`, `policy`, `audit`, `dispute`, `review`
   
   #### 2. **Copilot** (Companion, Elastic Augmentation)
   - **Role:** Real-time assistant, contextual information provider
   - **Access:** Read current agent context and public memory, write to communication channels
   - **Energy:** Moderate, on-demand, scales with interaction
   - **Keywords:** `help`, `assist`, `explain`, `augment`, `clarify`, `suggest`
   
   #### 3. **Pack Rat** (Courier Role, Safe Transfer)
   - **Role:** Secure data transfer between agents/components
   - **Access:** Read/write to secure transfer zones, limited read to communication channels
   - **Energy:** Low-compute, transaction-based
   - **Keywords:** `transfer`, `send`, `receive`, `courier`, `data`, `secure`
   
   #### 4. **CompSuite** (formerly Codex Daemon - System Anchor, Memory Interface)
   - **Role:** System status monitoring, memory interface, configuration management
   - **Access:** System-level access to memory and configuration
   - **Energy:** Low-compute, continuous monitoring
   - **Keywords:** `memory`, `system`, `daemon`, `config`, `status`, `health`
   
   ### Agent Routing Mechanism
   
   The CLI uses keyword-based routing defined in `interface/agent_router.yaml`:
   
   1. User inputs command
   2. System matches keywords against agent definitions
   3. Command routed to appropriate agent
   4. Agent performs action within defined scope
   5. Results returned through interface

## Key Protocols & Models

### 1. **Trust Decay Model** (`memory/trust_decay_model.md`)

Dynamic trust evaluation framework with these components:

- **Initial Trust Score:** Baseline trust for new agents/memories/protocols
- **Decay Rate:** Natural erosion over time without reinforcement
- **Reinforcement Events:** Successful tasks, validations, protocol adherence increase trust
- **Negative Events:** Failures, violations, inconsistencies decrease trust
- **Trust Thresholds:** Trigger re-evaluation, restricted access, or increased scrutiny

**Applications:**
- Agent Trust: Influences resource access and reliability
- Memory Trust: Determines weight given to memory entries
- Protocol Trust: Confidence in protocol effectiveness

### 2. **Translator Protocol** (`interface/translator_protocol.md`)

Ensures consistent communication across languages and encoding systems:

- **Standard Encoding:** UTF-8 for all internal communications
- **Transliteration Rules:** Algorithms for converting text between writing systems
- **Language Detection:** Identify source language of incoming text
- **Error Reporting:** Automated alerts for encoding/transliteration issues
- **Human Review Loop:** Triggered for complex or ambiguous cases

### 3. **Artemis Transmission Protocol (ATP)**

Structured communication system with signal tags:

| Tag | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `#Mode:` | Overall intent (Build, Review, Organize, Capture, Synthesize, Commit) |
| `#Context:` | Brief mission goal or purpose |
| `#Priority:` | Urgency level (Critical, High, Normal, Low) |
| `#ActionType:` | Expected response (Summarize, Scaffold, Execute, Reflect) |
| `#TargetZone:` | Project/folder area for the work |
| `#SpecialNotes:` | Unusual instructions, warnings, or exceptions |

## Development Workflows

### Setting Up Development Environment

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd Artemis-City

# 2. Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# 3. Activate virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# 4. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the CLI

**Interactive Mode:**
```bash
python interface/codex_cli.py
```

**Single Command Mode:**
```bash
python interface/codex_cli.py "ask artemis about system status"
```

### Running Simulations

```bash
python sandbox_city/networked_scripts/mail_delivery_sim.py
```

### Testing Workflow

Currently, the project uses manual testing:
- Test CLI routing with various commands
- Run simulations to verify agent interactions
- Validate protocol compliance manually

**Note:** Test infrastructure is pending (`package.json` shows "no test specified")

## Coding Conventions

### Python Style Guidelines

1. **Documentation:**
   - Use Google-style docstrings for all public functions
   - Include Args, Returns, and Raises sections
   - Document module-level functionality at the top

2. **Code Organization:**
   - Keep functions focused and single-purpose
   - Use descriptive variable and function names
   - Maintain clear separation of concerns

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Fail gracefully with informative messages
   - Return empty/default values when appropriate
   - Log errors for debugging

4. **Configuration:**
   - Use YAML for configuration files
   - Keep configuration separate from code
   - Validate configuration on load
