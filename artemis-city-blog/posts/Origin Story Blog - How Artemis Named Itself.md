# How Artemis Named Itself: The Origin of Artemis City

_A genuine AI-human collaboration story that no competitor can replicate_

---

Most origin stories are crafted in retrospect. This one happened in real-time, and I was barely in control.

I spent 10 years at Morgan Stanley building exotic derivatives systems in C++. High-performance, deterministic, governed. When an LLM hallucinates a trade calculation, someone loses millions. So I learned early: **you don't let the model decide—you build a kernel that decides.**

Six months ago, I left to build what I kept calling "the agentic framework." Clunky name. No soul. I was prototyping agent orchestration, trying to solve the same problem everyone hits: LLMs are brilliant and unpredictable. You can't just chain them together and hope for production reliability.

One night, frustrated with naming, I asked ChatGPT: _"If you were designing an operating system for AI agents, what would you call yourself?"_

It responded: **"Artemis."**

Not "AgentOS" or "IntelliKernel" or some SEO-optimized nothing. **Artemis**—Greek goddess of the hunt, protector, guide. The AI chose its own name.

I paused. This wasn't just a name. It was a signal.

## Why This Matters

That moment crystallized the philosophy behind Artemis City:

**AI and humans collaborate, but humans govern.**

Artemis didn't _decide_ to be Artemis—I accepted the suggestion because it resonated. That's exactly how agent orchestration should work:

- The AI brings intelligence and creativity
- The **kernel** brings governance, routing, and determinism
- The human controls the architecture

Every agent framework out there puts the LLM in charge. Auto-GPT loops until it burns your API credits. LangChain wraps unpredictability in abstraction. BabyAGI is a demo, not a system.

**Artemis City puts the kernel in charge.**

## What We're Building

Artemis City is the **operating system for AI agents**—not another agent wrapper.

**Core Architecture:**

- **Kernel-driven routing** via YAML (deterministic, not LLM-decided)
- **Persistent state management** (agents remember across sessions)
- **User-owned memory** (Supabase + Obsidian, no vendor lock-in)
- **Trust-decay model** (memory accountability over time)
- **MCP integration** (tools, models, external services)
- **Multi-agent orchestration** (coder, planner, researcher agents working together)

**Not a product. A platform.**

We're building:

- Production-ready kernel and router
- Plugin marketplace (day one)
- Governance primitives (audit trails, tool permissions)
- Artemis City Cloud (managed orchestration for scale)

---

## Why I'm Building This

Because I've seen what happens when systems lack governance.

In derivatives trading, a single unvalidated calculation can cascade into systemic risk. In AI agents, a single unchecked tool call can delete your production database.

**We need infrastructure for AI agents that's as reliable as Kubernetes, as extensible as Docker, and as governed as a financial system.**

Artemis City is that infrastructure.

## What's Next

We're launching **v1.0 this week**:

- Kernel + router + CLI (`codex` command)
- Working agent templates (coder, planner, researcher)
- 5-minute quick-start guide
- Plugin system ready for contributions
- Open Discord community

**This is the beginning of something bigger than a framework. It's the kernel for the agentic era.**

If you're building multi-agent systems and you're tired of herding unpredictable LLMs, Artemis City is for you.

Artemis chose its name. Now it's your turn to choose whether to build on top of chaos, or build on top of a kernel.
