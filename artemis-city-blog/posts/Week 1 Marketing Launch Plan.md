# 🎨 Brand Guidelines (Quick Reference)

**Positioning Statement:**

> Artemis City is the kernel-level operating system for AI agents—the infrastructure layer between unreliable LLMs and production-ready agent workflows.

**Brand Pillars:**

1. **Governance-First** — Safety and determinism built into the kernel
2. **User-Owned Memory** — Your knowledge base, your control
3. **Infrastructure-Level** — Not a tool, an operating system
4. **Open & Extensible** — Plugin ecosystem from day one

**Emotional Anchor:**

> From LLM Chaos → Agent Orchestration

**Voice & Tone:**

- Technical but accessible
- Confident without arrogance
- Systems-thinking mindset
- Infrastructure engineer, not marketer
