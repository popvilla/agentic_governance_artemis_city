Welcome to the debate.
So today we're diving into Artemis City,
this proposed agent-dick operating system architecture
that's getting a lot of attention.
The authors are presenting it as a really foundational shift
in how we approach multi-agent AI networks.
Right, and the ambition here is, well, it's pretty high.
They're basically claiming this specific architecture,
which is grounded in some really rigorous ideas
like cognitive morphogenesis and hebbian plasticity,
that this is the essential infrastructure
we need to even start scaling towards AGI.
Exactly, and that brings us to the central question,
which comes right out of the source material.
Does Artemis City really represent a genuine paradigm shift
towards this biological style self-evolving intelligence,
or is it's brilliance, which is undeniable?
More in being a highly effective, advanced engineered solution
for multi-agent orchestration that just, you know,
uses these cognitive metaphors for framing.
And I definitely fall into that latter camp.
I'm going to argue that the system's core functionality,
why it works so well, is because it relies on just
a masterful consolidation of established software engineering
and database patterns.
It's solving the immediate critical problems
of scalability and control that its predecessors
just completely failed on.
And my position is that the committed integration
of these deep cognitive principles
right at the infrastructure level creates
a fundamentally new category of AI system,
one that's structurally designed to grow
and evolve on its own, which is exactly
what a true general intelligence has to be able to do.
So for me, this whole thing with Artemis City,
it really feels like a necessary paradigm shift.
And that's because it moves our focus, you know,
away from just optimizing the intelligence of a single LLM core
and towards the collective intelligence of an orchestrated,
what they call an agent society.
This is why concepts like morphological computation
are so vital to its design.
The revolutionary part isn't just chaining agents together.
It's rooted in the philosophical choice
to draw on the 4E model of cognition,
embodied, embedded, and so on,
which suggests computation is partly offloaded
onto the structure itself.
But the structure is the environment here, right?
And those components, the kernel, the agent registry,
they are at the end of the day, engineering artifacts.
Well, yes, but their engineering artifacts
built for cognitive morphogenesis.
And that's the key distinction.
It means the system's internal structures,
the agents and the memory networks,
they're not designed to be static.
They're designed to self-assemble and evolve
their own topology, kind of like biological development.
This continuous self-construction,
where the system is constantly rewiring itself,
that's the cognitive leap.
It's not just an integration strategy.
The goal is emergence through structure.
I see why you think that.
But let's be precise about what this thing does right now.
I mean, Artemis City offers huge
and frankly, desperately needed improvements
over those fragile single-loop agents like AutoGPT.
We all know how much they struggle
with self-feedback and long-term memory.
But where does the white paper spend most of its time?
It's on detailing the kernel for scheduling tasks,
the agent registry for plug-and-play modularity,
and these governance layers with blocklists
and reputation scoring.
It functions exactly like an AI operating system should.
It coordinates specialized workers,
and that aligns perfectly with what the industry is demanding,
orchestration and control networks to solve
fundamental engineering problems.
But if it were just about coordination,
we wouldn't need to bake in a concept
like cognitive morphogenesis at the infrastructure level.
I come at it from a different way.
I think the authors use those concepts
to frame a very, very sophisticated piece of software architecture.
If you look at the components,
they're robust, known quantities.
We're talking super-based for vector storage,
obsidian for the knowledge graph,
extensive sandboxing.
The strength of this is its pragmatism.
It solves the immediate needs for deployment,
scalability, persistence, safety.
The sandboxing, for instance,
it's the same idea as a mobile OS
preventing a rogue app from wrecking your phone.
This is enterprise-grade design
that solves accountability,
and that's smart resource management,
not a cognitive revolution.
Okay, let's ground this in its most concrete claim.
The heavy and learning engine.
I mean, if the system were just some kind of fancy index optimizer,
why would you dedicate a core engine
to implement use-dependent organization
with analogues of long-term potentiation and depression?
What is that truly different from sophisticated indexing?
I think it is, because it dynamically adjusts
the links in its knowledge graph
based on productive co-activation,
not just how often something is used.
A static database tracks frequency,
a heavy and system tracks success,
and then structurally adapts its own internal connections
to prioritize those successful paths.
Okay, but the system you're describing
is still solving a fundamental data retrieval problem.
We know LLMs have limited context windows,
so Artemis City uses a hybrid memory system,
this obsidian knowledge vault for human readable stuff,
and the super-based vector store for semantic lookup.
That blend of explicit and associative memory
is just smart data architecture.
It's designed to solve a technical limitation.
But the necessity of that architecture
doesn't cancel out the cognitive mechanism.
The Hebian aspect is what elevates it.
The source material is clear that this learning
is validation-gated.
Updates to the connections using that classic Hebian rule
only happen when the outcomes pass quality checks,
so it learns based on validated success,
not just co-occurrence.
This explicitly prevents the reinforcement of errors
of hallucinations.
If your system constructurally adopts its own memory
to have an immune system against bad information,
well, that memory is truly plastic and adaptive,
not just efficiently organized.
That's an interesting point, though I would frame it differently.
I have to push back on this idea of the Hebian engine
being truly plastic in a biological sense.
The system is fundamentally solving retrieval latency
and integrity.
I mean, if you have this huge, expanding graph database
built from unverified agent output,
you absolutely must have a mechanism
to stop garbage from flooding the system.
Is that a neuroinspired weight decay function on a graph edge?
Conceptually, yes.
But functionally, it's just prioritizing retrieval paths
that have been proven to work.
It's a necessary, masterful solution
to data integrity at scale,
but I don't think it's emergent cognition.
I think the difference is in the intent.
You see a quality filter.
I see the deliberate design of a structure
that self-optimizes for truth-seeking,
and that adaptive capability isn't limited to memory,
it extends to control.
OK.
Let's look at governance and control,
because this is where Artemis City provides immediate
practical value, no matter how you frame it.
The agent registry and the kernel are vital,
because they provide essential control
through sandboxing and agent scoring.
They track reputation based on metrics
like relevance and faithfulness.
These features directly address
the most critical enterprise requirements,
trust, safety, auditability.
The first wave of agent wrappers
completely lacked this rigor.
This is critical for deployment,
but it feels like a refinement of control systems,
not some kind of cognitive breakthrough.
I'm not convinced by that line of reasoning,
because your view of the governance is too static.
It's ignoring the adaptive nature of the orchestration.
A standard control framework would rely on fixed rules,
but the roadmap here,
it describes moving beyond that
toward plastic, self-optimizing control.
And how does that manifest other than, you know,
tuning some parameters?
It manifests through reinforcement-based routing.
The kernel literally learns the optimal sequence of agents
for a complex problem based on reward feedback.
It's like the gating networks and mixture of experts models,
but applied to the whole agent ecosystem.
The system isn't just running a workflow,
it's learning how to run the workflow better.
And then there's the plan for inhibitory control,
the ability to suppress distracting agents or thoughts,
which is a direct parallel to human executive function.
When you describe it that way,
it reminds me of a giant,
complex enterprise workflow system,
maybe something from SAP or Oracle,
but with the neural net running the gatekeeper function.
It's an evolution in systems designed for sure,
making the scheduler adaptive,
but the reward signal is still defined by human oversight
or some preset metric.
I'm not sure it's a leap into a truly autonomous system.
But for me, the most compelling evidence
is the plan for plastic workflows
for self-modifying process definitions.
If the system can learn to rewire
its entire problem-solving pathway,
if the orchestration itself is plastic
and can autonomously change its own cognitive pipeline,
then it is moving beyond mere process management.
It's learning how to learn at a systemic level.
That self-optimization,
the autonomous rewriting of its internal process graph,
that feels like a direct realization of AGI principles.
Okay, the concept of plastic workflows
is undeniably ambitious, extremely valuable.
But even that can be framed within advanced engineering.
The system is essentially running continuous AB testing
on its own internal routes,
applying deep reinforcement learning
to a complex state machine.
The software complexity is immense,
but the building blocks, RL agents,
state management, graph databases,
they are still within the realm of engineering sophistication.
Let's shift to our third contention, then,
this idea of metaphorical versus literal interpretation.
I would argue that commitment to concepts
like morphological computation
is literally realized in the architecture.
You mean the idea of offloading computation
to the body or the structure?
Exactly.
The source material notes that by using a linked,
file-based graph, the Obsidian Vault,
a simple graph traversal actually performs efficient computation.
It reduces the load on the expensive LLM agents.
The structure shape, its topology,
helps compute the answers.
If the structure is doing work
that would otherwise require an LLM inference pass,
that is, by definition, offloading computation.
That is an excellent framing device, I'll give you that.
But what does that actually look like on the server rack?
It looks like an efficient data model.
I mean, using a linked graph is just smart
because the relationships are explicit
and rapidly traversable.
That's good, efficient modularity.
The system is smarter because its components are specialized.
But that specialization leads to emergent
metacognitive abilities.
Look at the visual cortex component,
which gives an interactive view of the knowledge topology.
This isn't just for human debugging.
The agents themselves can use this view
to perform meta-reasoning
by analyzing the emergent structure of their own knowledge.
And what does that analysis actually give them?
It allows the system to identify that, say, a key concept
is highly centralized in linked to a lot of irrelevant stuff,
which signals a knowledge bottleneck.
That is a form of self-reflection
based on the mind's physical structure.
That self-inspection goes far beyond simple feature engineering.
That's a compelling argument.
But if you consider the difference
between the vision and the implementation,
the system's robustness comes from treating agents
as embodied processes with the fine state and scope.
And that's just sandboxing and state management,
which is essential for any reliable software
regardless of the biological inspiration.
The practical components,
markdown files, super-based Postgres,
they aren't exotic cognitive tech.
They are pragmatic choices for reliability and interoperability.
The genius here is gluing these robust components together
in a way that mimics cognitive principles.
I think the architectural choices
create the conditions for genuine emergence.
The fact that the memory structure resists error
and the governance layer learns to rewire itself,
it suggests we've crossed a threshold.
We're not just chaining static models anymore.
We're building an integrated system
whose success depends on its ability to reorganize itself.
And that systemic adaptability
is what's necessary to scale towards general intelligence.
I wholeheartedly agree that Artemis City
is a crucial evolutionary step.
It consolidates best practices in orchestration,
memory management, and governance
that the industry desperately needs.
It is absolutely the necessary foundation
for serious AGI deployment
because it solves real world problems
of scalability and safety.
And whether we call strengthening
graph lengths hebian plasticity
or indexed optimization,
the result is a system that adapts and improves.
It really does represent
the height of modern integrated architecture.
At my core contention remains
that by committing to that cognitive framework
at the lowest levels,
the authors have fundamentally altered
the ceiling of what's possible.
It functions more like a living,
self-evolving digital organism
than a static piece of code.
I can certainly respect that ambition.
It pushes engineering to meet a visionary target.
The true nature of its innovation,
whether it's a genuine paradigm shift
or a profoundly refined integration,
I think that remains open for consideration
as the system develops.
Absolutely, but regardless,
Artemis's city represents a significant milestone.
It proves the frontier has decisively shifted
from building smarter single agents
to orchestrating intelligent,
governed, and scalable networks.
