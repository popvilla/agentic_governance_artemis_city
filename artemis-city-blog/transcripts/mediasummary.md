# Artemis City Media Summary

## Repository Orientation
- **Project**: Next.js + Tailwind MDX blog for Artemis City (agentic OS) with posts in `posts/`, media in `mediafiles/`, and core guidance in `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `GEMINI.md`.
- **Purpose of assets**: Communicate the Artemis City agentic operating system vision, onboarding, launch marketing, and whitepaper narrative; mix of written posts, audio/video talks, and one PDF whitepaper.

## Flagship Whitebook Content
- **mediafiles/Whitebook_Artemiscity** (raw whitebook) and **posts/Whitepaper - Agentic OS Architecture.md** (blog version) describe an agentic OS with a kernel-orchestrated multi-agent society, hybrid memory bus (Obsidian graph + Supabase vectors), Hebbian plasticity for link weights, governance/scorekeeping, and roadmap items (RL-based routing, inhibitory control, memory decay, plastic workflows). Tone is academic/visionary with extensive citations and comparative analysis vs. AutoGPT/BabyAGI/AgentVerse.
- Includes a “Things to add” section calling for: memory bus sync semantics, quantum lock theory integration, cost/performance KPIs, decay logging, sandbox enforcement visibility, governance for self-updates/CI-style gating, and updated Discord invite (https://discord.gg/T2Huqg4c).

## Key Written Assets in `posts/`
- **5-Minute Quick Start Guide**: Step-by-step install, init, and first multi-agent run via `codex` CLI; highlights memory bus listing and routing config.
- **Why LLM Wrappers Fail (And What to Build Instead)**: Critiques single-LLM loops (non-deterministic routing, runaway loops, weak memory/governance) and promotes kernel-driven architecture.
- **Comparison – Artemis City vs Auto-GPT**: Positioning against AutoGPT’s cost/looping issues and BabyAGI’s scalability gaps; emphasizes Artemis City’s multi-agent OS model.
- **Discord Community Structure**: Roles/channels and engagement plan for community onboarding.
- **First Journey Into Artemis City**: Narrative walkthrough introducing the platform’s promise and onboarding pitch.
- **GitHub README – First 30 Seconds**: Ultra-short setup checklist and repo orientation.
- **HackerNews Launch Post**: HN-focused pitch stressing agentic OS differentiation and call to star the repo.
- **Launch Week Social Media Kit**: Prewritten tweets/LinkedIn copy plus CTAs to Discord, GitHub, whitepaper.
- **Origin Story Blog – How Artemis Named Itself**: Brand story explaining naming and identity.
- **Week 1 Marketing Launch Plan**: Day-by-day launch channels, assets, and CTAs.
- **Whitepaper - Agentic OS Architecture**: Blog-friendly rendering of the whitebook (same substance as above).

## Supporting Docs
- **README.md**: Next.js blog overview, install/build instructions, MDX authoring guidance.
- **agentslog.md**: December 2025 change log (import cleanup, slug handling, MDX fixes, build attempts).
- **CLAUDE.md / GEMINI.md**: Agent guidance plus recent UI/theme updates (nav tabs, layout refresh, Tailwind palette/animations).

## Recorded / Visual Media in `mediafiles/`
- **ArtemisCity_Agentic_Operating_System.pdf**: PDF version of the agentic OS whitepaper.
- **Poster.png**: Visual promo asset (not inspected for content; likely brand/launch poster).
- **Videos**: `app.component.mp4`, `Artemis_City__An_AI_OS.mp4`, `Quantum_Teleportation.mp4`, `The_Two_Frontiers_of_Digital_Trust.mp4` (titles suggest product explainer plus quantum/Trust topics).
